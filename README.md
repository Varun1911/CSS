<center><h1>CSS</h1></center>
Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in markup languages like HTML, XML, etc.<br />
<br />
There are 3 ways of applying CSS to our document
<ul>
    <li>external stylesheet 
    <li>internal stylesheet
    <li>inline styling
</ul>

If we use all the ways together, inline styling has the highest priority. The other 2 have same priority and the one that is given priority depends upon which is declared later. Priority is only checked if the properties are clashing, otherwise all of them will be applied.

**Errors**<br />
If there is some error in CSS, it will just be ignored. One way to know the errors is to validate your css online on platforms like W3C.
