<center><h1>CSS</h1></center>
Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in markup languages like HTML, XML, etc.<br />
<br />
There are 3 ways of applying CSS to our document
<ul>
    <li>external stylesheet 
    <li>internal stylesheet
    <li>inline styling
</ul>

If we use all the ways together, inline styling has the highest priority. The other 2 have same priority and the one that is given priority depends upon which is declared later. Priority is only checked if the properties are clashing, otherwise all of them will be applied.

**Errors**<br />
If there is some error in CSS, it will just be ignored. One way to know the errors is to validate your css online on platforms like W3C.


<h2>Selectors</h2>
1) <b>Element Selector</b> - Selects all the elements of that type in the document. Example : 

```css
body{
}; 
p{
}
```
<hr />
2) <b>Class Selector</b> - Selects all elements that have the specified class name. We need to put a period (.) before the class name. Example : 

```css
.grey{
}
```
<hr />
3) <b>ID Selector</b> - Selects the element with the specified ID. We need to put a hash(#) before the id name. Example : 

```css
#itlics{
} 
```
<br />
We should avoid using ID Selectors in CSS.<hr />
4) <b>Universal Selector</b> - Selects all the elements. Ex - 

```css
*{
}
```
<hr><br>

We can group selectors like - 
```css
h1, h2{
}
```

We can select nested elements like so - 
```css
h1 h2{}
```
<br />
This will give us all the h2 inside an h1

**Cascading and Specificity** - 
CSS reads from top to down applying rules, that means whichever rule is applied last will override the same rule if mentioned before it as well.This only applied to selectors of same specificity. Classes have more specificty than elements so they will override element rules even if they are written before the element rules.

*Note* - You can check which CSS properties are applied and which are ignored using dev tools on the browser.

**Inheritance** - When we apply a property to a parent element is inherited by the children. Not all properties can be inherited.

*Note* - Form elements do not inherit properties by default. We can explicitly make them inherit by - <br />

```css
    button, input, textarea, select{
        font : inherit;
    }
```
